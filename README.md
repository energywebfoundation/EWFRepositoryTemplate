# EW-DOS
//This should be the same in every repo. 
The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System is a blockchain-based, multi-layer digital infrastructure. 

The purpose of EW-DOS is to develop and deploy an open and decentralized digital operating system for the energy sector in support of a low-carbon, customer-centric energy future. 

We develop blockchain technology, full-stack applications and middleware packages that facilitate participation of Distributed Energy Resources on the grid and create open market places for transparent and efficient renewable energy trading.
